# Express API Project

This was my first backend assignment, the goal was to learn more about heroku, endpoints, using postman and handling data. 

## The problem
 Back end is pretty far from the fornt-end we have been doing, Im intrigued and looking forward to putting more time into this. 

## View it live
note this is only the backend part...
available endpoints are: 
/avocados
/avocados/{id}
